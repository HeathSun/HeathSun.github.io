<span class='anchor' id='about-me'>
Hello there! I'm He (Shawn) Sun,  a passionate undergraduate researcher, developer and product manager. I am currently in my second year of studying for a Bachelor of Science (Hons) in Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence at the University of Nottingham. Additionally, I scored top 3% in a deep learning program at the University of Oxford in 2022 summer. 

As the founder and CEO of FateAlgo Ltd, I've led the development of an AI-native application offering tarot reading and divination services, securing £50,000 in funding from the Li Dak Sum Innovation Foundation and as the youngest member in history, acceptance into the 13th batch of [ZhenResidence](https://en.zhenfund.com/News/77) (25 start-ups/year) held by [ZhenFund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZhenFund).

In research, my contributions span diverse fields. At [Zhejiang University](https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/zhejiang-university), I completed all programming aspects of the multi-luminescence optogenetic platform for wound-healing, set for publication in "Nature Biotechnology". Additionally, my research assistant work on functional quantum programming at the University of Science and Technology of China resulted in a compiler for the "Quantric" language, winning the 17th [“Challenge Cup”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge_Cup_Competition_of_Science_Achievement_in_China) Academic Sci&Tech Contest National 1st Prize. I participated in research on computer vision and machine reading comprehension at my university and the China Beacons Institute. I also delivered a speech representing our work at The 3rd Symposium on Science and Engineering Education, hosted by the [China Association for Science and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Association_for_Science_and_Technology).

On a personal front, I've channeled my creativity into various projects, such as the eco-economic model for the Maasai Mara and asteroid mining on global equity, which won meritorious prize in the International Mathematical Contest in Modeling and  the International Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (featured on Universe Today, a prominent Canadian astronomy tech media outlet). My accolades also include the Zhejiang Provincial Scholarship, the UNNC Dean's Scholarship, and the UNNC Outstanding Student Leader award, among others. My diverse projects range from human-computer interaction design to Java game development and a personal poetry website.
